# 💡 Executive Finance Reporting App

Finance teams often struggle with fragmented reporting across performance, cashflow, balance sheet, and budget variance. This app consolidates all financial insights into a single, navigable Power BI experience—enabling leadership to monitor performance, understand liquidity, and track budget adherence in real time.

This project demonstrates an end‑to‑end Business Intelligence solution for a fictional SaaS startup. It bridges the gap between raw operational data and **strategic financial analytics**, built on rigorous integration logic and full **financial reconciliation**.
